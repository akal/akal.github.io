I'm reading through the NLTK book, running examples in Emacs. NLTK is
installed in a virtualenv, which Emacs does not know what to do with.

The solution is https://github.com/aculich/virtualenv.el.

Downloaded it to emacs load path, using it via

    >(require 'virtualenv)


It needs a directory, ~/virtualenvs, into which I've symlinked the
virtualenv containing NLTK:


    >ll ~/virtualenvs
    [...] nltk-env@ -> /Users/akal/repo/nltk/env/


There are two ways to activate the virtualenv from emacs:

*     M-x virtualenv-workon nltk-env

* automatically when opening a python source file, by adding the file
  .dir-locals.el to the project. However I could not get this to
  work.
