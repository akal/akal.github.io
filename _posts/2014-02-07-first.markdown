After sitting on the basic jekyll site for a few days, I'm finally
publishing it.

When creating the github repository for the blog, one thing I did not
notice immediately is that changes are not instantaneous, some time is
required for it to be visible on the public url. It took a few minutes
to appear.

Setting up Jekyll and customizing the basic behavior is really easy.

TODO: Replace the default templates with something more pleasing.
